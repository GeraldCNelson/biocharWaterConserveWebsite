# Welcome to the Biochar Project

This is an introduction to the project. Here's what you can expect:

- Overview of the biochar experiment.
- Key objectives and goals.
- How to use the app.

## What is Biochar?

Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (International Biochar Initiative). 

- **Surface area:** ~2,000 ftÂ²/gram (half a basketball court!)
- **Water Holding Capacity:** Up to ~7 times its weight in water.

## The Biochar Experiment

The experiment is underway at the **Fruita Research Station of Colorado State University**. It began in **Spring 2023**. 

The image below shows the layout of the experimental field. It was an unused pasture experiment plot when we first started. There are **four strips**, numbered 1 to 4 from left (**west**) to right (**east**). 

- **Strips 1 and 3** had biochar injected every 6 inches to an approximate depth of 6 inches.
- **Strips 2 and 4** had no biochar amendment.

Irrigation for the field is done using **furrow irrigation**, with the furrows spaced X inches apart. Irrigation water is applied at the **north** end (top of the image) and runs down the furrows, **infiltrating into the soil** until it is saturated. Any excess runs into a **drainage ditch** at the **south** end.
