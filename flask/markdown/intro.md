# Biochar Injection Experiment, 2022-2024

# Welcome to the Biochar Project

This is an introduction to the project. Here's what you can expect:

- Overview of the biochar experiment.
- Key objectives and goals.
- How to use the app.

Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. (International Biochar Initiative). Surface area: ~2,000 ft<sup>2</sup>/gram (half a basketball court!)Water Holding Capacity = Up to ~ 7 times its weight in water.

The experiment is underway at the Fruita Research Statio of Colorado State University. It began in Spring 2023. The image below shows the layout of the experimental field. It was an unused pasture experiment plot when we first started. There are four strips, numbered 1 to 4 from left (west) to right (east). Strips 1 and 3 had biochar injected every 6 inches to an approximate depth of 6 inches. Strips 2 and 4 had no biochar amendment. 

Irrigation for the field is done with furrow irrigation, with the furrows spaced x inchs apart. Irrigation water is applied at the top of the image (north) and runs down the furrows, infiltrating into the soil until it is saturated. Any excess runs into a drainage ditch at the south end.
