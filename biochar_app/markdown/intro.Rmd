# Welcome to the Fruita Biochar Project

[Note: This is an early version of this website. Expect problems. If you find one or just have a suggestion for improvements, please email *nelson.gerald.c\@gmail.com*.]

This is an introduction to the project. Here's what you can expect:

-   An introduction to what biochar is and why it is potentially valuable in western Colorado (and other drought prone areas of the world).
-   Overview of the biochar experiment at the Colorado State University research station outside Fruita, CO.
-   Digital data collection results in graphical (Main Data Display tab) and tabular form (Summary Statistics tab)
-   Technical details on the data collection process.
-   Coming soon, biochar source and characteristics, fertilizer application, soil results and yield quantity and quality

## What is Biochar?

Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (International Biochar Initiative).

-   **Surface area:** \~2,000 ftÂ²/gram (half a basketball court!)
-   **Water Holding Capacity:** Up to \~7 times its weight in water.

For those interested in the chemistry, a bit of biological history is in order. In plant-based biochar, a key element of vascular plants is the carbohydrate *lignan*. It provides the support structure for plants, allowing them to adapt to life on land. A diagram of the chemical formula for lignan is below.
