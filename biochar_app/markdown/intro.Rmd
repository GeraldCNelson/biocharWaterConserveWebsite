# Welcome to the Fruita Biochar Project

This is an introduction to the project. Here's what you can expect:

-   Overview of the biochar experiment.
-   Digital data collection results in graphical and tabular form
-   Technical details on the process.
-   Coming soon, biochar source and characterics, fertilizer application, soil results and yield quantity and quality

## What is Biochar?

Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (International Biochar Initiative).

-   **Surface area:** \~2,000 ftÂ²/gram (half a basketball court!)
-   **Water Holding Capacity:** Up to \~7 times its weight in water.
