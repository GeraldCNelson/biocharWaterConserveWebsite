## The Biochar Experiment

The experiment is underway at the Fruita Research Station of Colorado State University. It began in Spring 2023.

The image below shows the layout of the experimental field. It was an unused pasture experiment plot when we first started. There are four strips, numbered 1 to 4 from left (west) to right (east). Each strip is about xx ft wide and yy ft long.

-   Strips 1 and 3 had biochar injected every 6 inches to an approximate depth of 6 inches.
-   Strips 2 and 4 had no biochar amendment.

Irrigation for the field is done using furrow irrigation, with the furrows spaced X inches apart. Irrigation water is applied at the north end (top of the image) and runs down the furrows, infiltrating into the soil until it is saturated. Any excess runs into a drainage ditch at the south end of the field.
