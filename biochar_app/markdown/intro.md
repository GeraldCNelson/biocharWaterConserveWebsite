# Welcome to the Fruita Biochar Project

This is an introduction to the project. Here’s what you can expect:

-   An introduction to what biochar is and why it is potentially
    valuable in western Colorado (and other drought prone areas of the
    world).
-   Overview of the biochar experiment at the Colorado State University
    research station outside Fruita, CO.
-   Digital data collection results in graphical (Main Data Display tab)
    and tabular form (Summary Statistics tab)
-   Technical details on the data collection process.
-   Coming soon, biochar source and characteristics, fertilizer
    application, soil results and yield quantity and quality

## What is Biochar?

Biochar is the solid material obtained from the thermochemical
conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment (International
Biochar Initiative).

-   **Surface area:** ~2,000 ft²/gram (half a basketball court!)
-   **Water Holding Capacity:** Up to ~7 times its weight in water.
